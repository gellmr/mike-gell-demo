          This will send a single-use token to your email address. The token will be a randomly generated sequence of digits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your account will not be affected. You can ignore the email and everything will be fine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Or you can use the token, and provide a new password.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To use the token, click the link in the email provided. This will cause the following to happen:
        </p>
        <p>
          Your account will be logged out, and nobody will be able to log in as you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will see a page like this one, asking for you to provide a new password.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reset token is only valid for ten minutes. If you don't click it, nothing will happen and your account remains unaffected.
          If you click it, and provide a new password, you will have successfully reset your password.
          If you click it, but don't provide a new password (within ten minutes) then the token expires and your account remains inactive. You need to request another token.
