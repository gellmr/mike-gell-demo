Hi <%= @user.first_name %>
<br />
<br />
Our system has received a request to reset the password on your account.
<br />
<br />
If you did not request this, then please ignore this email. Your account and password will stay the same.
<br />
<br />
If you did request a password reset, then please use the link below to set a new password.
<br />
<br />
<%= link_to "Set New Password", set_new_password_url(token: @user.password_reset_token, email: @user.email)%>
<br />
<br />
Note - the token is only valid for 10 minutes. If you dont set a new password in this time, you will need to request a new token.
<br />
<br />
Thanks!
